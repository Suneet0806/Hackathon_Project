#  Projectile Motion Simulator

## Overview
An interactive, web-based projectile motion simulator designed
to help learners understand the physics of motion through real-time
visualization and gameplay. The project combines classical kinematics with
modern UI elements to create an engaging educational experience.

The simulation demonstrates the independence of horizontal and vertical
motions, the effect of gravity, air resistance, and wind, and allows users to
experiment with different launch parameters across multiple environments.
